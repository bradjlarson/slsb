#SQL Library and Script Builder

##What is SLSB?

This is a tool that I created to make writing SQL, particularly for the purposes of analysis, much easier. It does three main things:
- Allows you to collaboratively document and search your database architecture
- Installs a "metric" system, which allows you to easily save and reuse queries
- Condenses the sytnax

Depending on how you use it, I estimate it has the potential to compress the code you'll actually write 5-100x, as well as reducing errors substantially.
Since there is no cap on the length of the metric, you can store a thousand line query as a single metric, and then reuse that code with a single line of code later. 

##What's next:
- Finish documentation
- Finish parsing for all commands
- Finish Tutorial
- Allow you to annotate DB Explorer
- Add admin panel
- Figure out settings
- Get ready to productionize
